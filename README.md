# Weight Distribution Analysis in Python


📦📦📦📦📦📦📦📦📦📦📦📦📦📦📦📦

This project analyzes the distribution of package weights using frequency tables and visualizations. It’s built with **pandas** and **matplotlib**, and it’s ideal for beginners who want to learn how to:

- Calculate absolute (`fi`), cumulative (`Fi`), and relative (`hi`) frequencies
- Plot clean and readable bar charts in Python
- Understand basic data analysis concepts using real-world examples

---

## Dataset

The dataset includes weight ranges (in kg) and the number of registered packages (`fi`):

| Weight Range (kg) | fi  |
|-------------------|-----|
| 1.00 - 2.99       | 67  |
| 3.00 - 4.99       | 124 |
| 5.00 - 7.99       | 98  |
| 8.00 - 11.99      | 23  |
| 12.00 - 14.99     | 57  |
| 15.00 - 19.99     | 21  |

---

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- matplotlib

---

## Output

The script calculates:

- `fi`: Absolute frequency
- `Fi`: Cumulative frequency
- `hi`: Relative frequency
- `Hi`: Cumulative relative frequency

And it displays 4 bar charts:  
1. Absolute frequency  
2. Cumulative frequency  
3. Relative frequency  
4. Cumulative relative frequency

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
python main.py
